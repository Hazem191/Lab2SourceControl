<font color ="green" > My dog Sosha is my best friend. She likes to chase
the soccer ball when I practice. It is so funny to
see her running down the field trying to catch the
ball with her mouth. It just won't fit!

<p><font color ="green" >Once Sasha saved my life. When I wes enly 4 years old, I started te go inte the street te get a ball that
hod rolled ocross the street. Of course I did nat think to look for cars! Sasha got in front of me and
knecked me backwards ento the sidewelk. I wes mod until I saw the car go by where I would have been.
Then I was so happy that Sasha was smarter than I was!</font></p>
